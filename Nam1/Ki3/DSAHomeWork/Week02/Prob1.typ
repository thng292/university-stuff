An algorithm that should not be considered an application of the brute-force approach is *Quick Sort*

Quick sort used a stragedy called Divide and Conquer, which results in a much better run time complexity.

A problem that can not be solved by brute-force is "N-Queens". If we solve this problem using a brute-force algorithm like: 
- Generate all possible position for N queen ($N^N$ possible configuration) and check if the board is valid
This brute-force algorithm has $O(N^N)$ run time complexity, which is very impractical.
