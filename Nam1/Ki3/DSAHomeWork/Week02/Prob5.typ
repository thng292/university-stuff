=
- The time complexity of this algorithm is $O(N^2)$.
- This version instead of assignment, it does a swap. If we consider a swap as 3 assignment, then this version will be slower than the version given in the slide. But this algorithm can be useful to solve the problem where whe can only move the element like Problem 3 or Problem 4.
