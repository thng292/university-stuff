If all elements have the same value, the work it takes to do a partition is $O(n)$ and each recursive call only reduce the problem size by 1. 

This mean we have n recursive call, with each call has $O(n)$ time complexity.

#sym.arrow.double This is the worst case for Quick Sort. The time complexity is $O(n^2)$
