= For each of the following pairs of functions, indicate whether the first function of each of the following pairs has a lower, same, or higher order of growth (to within a constant multiple) than the second function.
== $𝑛(𝑛 + 1)$ and $2000𝑛^2$
#sym.arrow Same order of growth
== $100𝑛^2$ and $0.01n^3$ 
#sym.arrow  Lower order of growth
== $log_2𝑛$ and $ln n$
#sym.arrow Same order of growth
== $(log_2𝑛)^2$ and $log_2𝑛^2$
#sym.arrow Higher order of growth
== $2^(n-1)$ and $2^n$
#sym.arrow Same order of growth
== $(𝑛-1)!$ and $n!$
#sym.arrow Lower order of growth
