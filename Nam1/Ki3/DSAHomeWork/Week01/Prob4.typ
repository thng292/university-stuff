= List the following functions according to their order of growth from the lowest to the highest:

- $(n-2)!∈ O((n-2)!)$
- $5lg(n+100)^10 = 50lg(n+100)∈ O(log n)$
- $2^(2n) = (2^2)^n = 4^n∈O(4^n)$
- $0.001n^4 + 3n^3+1∈n^4$
- $(ln n)^2∈O((log n)^2) $
- $root(3, n) ∈ O(n^(1/3)) $
- $3^n ∈ 3^n$

#sym.arrow.double Therefore, the list of these function in the order of growth looks as follows:
$5lg(n+100)^10 #sym.arrow (ln n)^2 #sym.arrow root(3,n) #sym.arrow 0.001n^4 + 3n^3 + 1 #sym.arrow 2^(2n) #sym.arrow (n-2)!$\
