= For each of the following algorithms, indicate (i) a natural size metric for its inputs, (ii) its basic operation, and (iii) whether the basic operation count can be different for inputs of the same size:
== Computing the sum of n numbers: 
- (i): $n$
- (ii): The addition of 2 numbers
- (iii): No, the algorithm always run through all input numbers
== Computing $𝑛!$:
- (i): Number of bits to represent $n$
- (ii): The mutiplication of 2 numbers
- (iii): Yes, the number of basic operations depends on the value of the input, not the size fo the input itself
== Finding the largest element in a list of n numbers:
- (i): $n$
- (ii): The comparison of 2 numbers
- (iii): No, the algorithm always run through all input numbers
== Euclid’s algorithm to find the GCD of two integers:
- (i): The number of bits to represent two input integers
- (ii): The modulo and comparation of 2 numbers
- (iii): Yes, the number of basic operation depends on the value of two input integers, not the size of the input
